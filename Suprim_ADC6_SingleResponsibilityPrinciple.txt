The name of the principle says it all:

“One class should have one and only one responsibility”

In other words, we should write, change and maintain a class
for only one purpose. If it is model class then it should strictly
represent only one actor/ entity. This will give we the flexibility
to make changes in future without worrying the impacts of changes for
another entity.
Similarly, If we are writing service/manager class then it should contain
only that part of method calls and nothing else. Not even utility global 
functions related to module. Better separate them in another globally accessible
class file. This will help in maintaining the class for that particular purpose, 
and we can decide the visibility of class to specific module only.
