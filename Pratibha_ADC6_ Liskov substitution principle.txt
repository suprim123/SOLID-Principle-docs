Likov's Substitution Principle

It states that if a program module is using a Base class, then the reference to the Base class can
 be replaced with a Derived class without affecting the functionality of the program module.

example:
In mathematics, a Square is a Rectangle. Indeed it is a specialization of a rectangle. The "is a" makes you want to model this with
 inheritance. However if in code you made Square derive from Rectangle, then a Square should be usable anywhere you expect a Rectangle.
  This makes for some strange behavior.

  public class Rectangle {

    private int length;
    private int breadth;

    public int getLength() {
        return length;
    }
    public void setLength(int length) {
        this.length = length;
    }
    public int getBreadth() {
        return breadth;
    }
    public void setBreadth(int breadth) {
        this.breadth = breadth;
    }
    public int getArea() {
        return this.length * this.breadth;
    }
}

Git Pull
    Git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the 
    local repository to match that content. The git pull command is actually a combination of two other commands,
     git fetch followed by git merge.

How it works?
    The git pull command first runs git fetch which downloads content from the specified remote repository. 
    Then a git merge is executed to merge the remote content refs and heads into a new local merge commit.
     To better demonstrate the pull and merging process let us consider the following example. Assume we have a repository 
     with a master branch and a remote origin.
